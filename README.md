### Overview

This project is a python library (SDK) for working with [IBM Analytics Engine (IAE)](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/AnalyticsEngine/index.html).  

#### Documentation

Documentation can be found on [readthedocs](http://ibm-analytics-engine-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

Some example notebooks using this library:

 - [Creating a Cluster](docs/example_notebooks/CreateCluster.ipynb)
 - [Connecting a Jupyter Notebook](docs/example_notebooks/DockerExampleNB2KG.ipynb)
 
See a recording of these notebooks [in action](https://m.youtube.com/watch?t=1s&v=3plYcRHvV9w).  The recording has a few editing issues and no audio, but you should get the idea.

### Support
