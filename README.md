### Overview

This project is a python library for working with [IBM Analytics Engine (IAE)](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/AnalyticsEngine/index.html).  This project is still quite young and as such it is changing quite a bit, however, it should be stable enough for everyday use.

#### Documentation

Documentation can be found on [readthedocs](http://ibm-analytics-engine-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

An [example notebook](docs/example_notebooks/CreateCluster.ipynb) that uses this library
